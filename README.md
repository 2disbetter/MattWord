# MattWord
A simple, lightweight, document editor and word processor application. 

This point of this application is to small and light weight. At this point in life most people have used many word processors and document editing applications. We know how they work and we rarely need all of the functionality that they embed. The point of this editor is to simply allow you to create documents, spell check them, insert images, and print them. The documents are saved as an html file. Currently MattWord only uses this format and does not do any conversion. Conversion is on the road map though.
