# MattWord
A simple, lightweight, QT based document editor and word processor application. 

This point of this application is to be a small and light weight. At this point most people have used many word processors and document editing applications. We know how they work and we rarely need all of the functionality that they embed. The point of this editor is to simply allow you to create documents, spell check them, insert images, and print them. The documents are saved as an html file. Currently MattWord only uses this format and does not do any conversion. Conversion is on the road map though. 

The executable is under 3 megs and the whole thing runs in most Linux setups under 100 megs of RAM. This isn't a benchmark that has to be maintained. This is just an indication where the project is at this point.

MattWord has QT6 for dependencies and if you want spellchecking you will need aspell and aspell-en. This has been tested on Omarchy and Arch Linux. Should work on other distros provided the dependencies can be met.
